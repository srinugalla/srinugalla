# Production Architecture Mindset

Typical delivery workflow I work with:

```
Developer Commit
    ↓
Git Repository
    ↓
CI Pipeline (Jenkins / GitHub Actions)
    ↓
Container Build (Docker)
    ↓
Registry Push
    ↓
Kubernetes Deployment
    ↓
GitOps Sync (Argo CD)
    ↓
Monitoring (Prometheus + Grafana)
```

Focus: repeatable deployments, controlled releases, observable production systems.

# About Me

DevOps Engineer focused on building scalable cloud infrastructure, Kubernetes environments, and automated deployment workflows for production systems.

I specialise in infrastructure as code, container orchestration, and CI/CD automation using AWS, Terraform, Kubernetes, Python scripting, and GitOps workflows with Argo CD.

My goal is to reduce operational risk, remove manual deployment steps, and provide stable platforms that allow engineering teams to deliver safely and consistently.
